Large-scale multi-cell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (LS-MIMO) systems have received much attention recently. But the performance of these systems is deteriorated by imperfect channel state information (CSI). Hence, in this paper, a subspace-based semi-blind channel estimator is proposed.
