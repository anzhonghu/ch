excerpt: 'This paper proposes a direction-of-arrival (DOA)-based beamforming approach for multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). The proposed approach utilizes the steering vectors of the URA to form a basis of the spatial space and selects the partial space for beamforming according to the DOA information.'

This paper proposes a direction-of-arrival (DOA)-based beamforming approach for multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). The proposed approach utilizes the steering vectors of the URA to form a basis of the spatial space and selects the partial space for beamforming according to the DOA information.
