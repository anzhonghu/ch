excerpt: 'In millimeter-wave massive multiple input multiple output multiuser systems, inter-user interference becomes a major factor limiting system capacity. The premise of increasing system capacity is to minimize inter-user interference on the basis of ensuring large receiving power. In response to this situation, this paper proposes a low complexity

In millimeter-wave massive multiple input multiple output multiuser systems, inter-user interference becomes a major factor limiting system capacity. The premise of increasing system capacity is to minimize inter-user interference on the basis of ensuring large receiving power. In response to this situation, this paper proposes a low complexity
grouping optimization based hybrid beamforming (HBF) algorithm.
