excerpt: 'In this paper, beam selection for millimeter-wave multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems that employ zero-forcing based analog-digital hybrid processing is investigated. By first assuming full channel state information, the problem of joint beam selection is formulated and the concept of spatial overlapping index (SOI) is proposed to deal with the strong interference imposed by the MSs which share beams with some other MSs.'

In this paper, beam selection for millimeter-wave multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems that employ zero-forcing based analog-digital hybrid processing is investigated. By first assuming full channel state information, the problem of joint beam selection is formulated and the concept of spatial overlapping index (SOI) is proposed to deal with the strong interference imposed by the MSs which share beams with some other MSs.
